The quickstarts demonstrate Eclipse MicroProfile and a few additional technologies from the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform expansion pack stack. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.

This branch contains the latest 4.0 release of the Red Hat JBoss EAP expansion pack quickstarts.

Please refer to the root README.html for additional information.
